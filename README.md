## Important Notes

- Please follow website terms of use and robots.txt
- Set reasonable scraping frequency to avoid server load
- Some companies may use different page structures, check logs if issues occur

## Troubleshooting

1. **No job data found**: Check if company URL is correct
2. **JSON parsing failed**: Page structure may have changed, need to update regex
3. **Request failed**: Check network connection or wait and retry later
